# Portfolio-Allocation-Techniques-for-Processing-Covariance-Matrices.

## 1. Introduction 
The hypothesis: 
- We consider the day 1000 as today 
- We took a risk-free rate of 1% 
- We donâ€™t allow short selling 
- We take only 10 assets in order to simplify the lecture of the result and reduce the time of computing 
- Time metrics were calculated on a 30 or 90 day basis 
## 2. Optimisation
- Build efficient frontiers 
- The Minimum Variance Portfolio and the Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio 
- Robust Optimisation 
## 3. The techniques for Covariance Matrics
- Eigenvalue Clipping 
- Oracle Estimator 
- Cross Validate Eigenvalue Shrinkage 
## 4. Comparison
- Eigenvalue Distribution 
- The cost of transaction, turnover and cumulative return
## 5. Adding a risk-free asset
- The Capital Market Line 
- The metrics with free-risk assets 
## 6. Conclusion
